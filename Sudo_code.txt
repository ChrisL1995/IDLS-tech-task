SUDO:

create 2 puzzleboxes:
Store class in divider -> <div class="puzzlebox"></div>
	(Make puzzlebox using a class)
		class Puzzleboard {
			define variables...
			}  (additional info given in figure 1)

create 5 containers within each box:
	for bottom puzzlebox:
		- Create list of images in ts file (star)
		- call list in html <div cdkDrag *ngFor="for image in images"><img src="{{image}}"></div>
			Here images would be a list of path strings. so <string[]>?
		- align images horizontally. (display: inline(-flex/block)?)
	
Make list dragabble:
	- wrap list with dragdroplist.
	<div cdkDropList>
		...list...
	</div>
	- create droppable function in .ts, link into html via (cdkDropListDropped) ="drop($event)" in cdkDropList


Link both lists so you can drag between each one, done in <div cdkDropList>
	<div cdkDropList
	[cdkDropListData] = "images"
	(cdkDropListDropped) = "drop($event)"
	[cdkDropListConnectedTo] = "otherListName"
	#thisListName="cdkDropList" (connect this cdkDropList object to the name "thisListName">
	</div>
